# Build BeerBomber

Your need SDL 2.0 Library installed, you can install it with `brew` for MacOS

```shell
$ brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf sdl2_mixer
```

Or with `apt-source` for Linux based OS

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf sdl2_mixer
```

Then you can build BeerBomber with the Make rule `all`
```shell
$ make all
```

You will have an executable named `beerbomber` that you can run

#### Enjoy ! :bomb::bomb::fire::beers:
