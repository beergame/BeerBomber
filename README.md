# Build BeerBomber

Your need SDL 2.0 Library installed, you can install it with `brew` for MacOS

``` shell
$ brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf sdl2_mixer
```

Or with `apt-source` for Linux based OS

``` shell
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-dev && \
                       libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

Then you can build BeerBomber with the Make rule `all`
``` shell
$ make all
```

You will have an executable named `beerbomber` that you can run

#### Enjoy ! :bomb::bomb::fire::beers:
